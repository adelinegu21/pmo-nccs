### CARBON TAX

**1. What is the role of the carbon tax in Singapore’s mitigation strategy?**

The carbon tax forms part of our comprehensive suite of mitigation measures by providing a broad-based price signal across the economy. The revised carbon tax level and trajectory is aligned with our climate ambition to reach net zero by or around mid-century. This will also accelerate the economic transformation necessary to transition to a future-ready green economy by enhancing the business case to implement energy efficiency improvements and other emission reduction solutions. This ensures the long-term viability of business investments and activities in a carbon-constrained world.

**2. Who is covered under the carbon tax?**

The tax is applied on facilities that directly emit at least 25,000 tCO<sub>2</sub>e of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions annually and includes six GHGs that Singapore is currently reporting to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), namely carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), methane (CH<sub>4</sub>), nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and sulphur hexafluoride (SF<sub>6</sub>). Singapore will also start reporting a seventh GHG, nitrogen trifluoride (NF<sub>3</sub>) by 2024. As such, we intend to include NF<sub>3</sub> as a taxable gas at a suitable juncture.

The inclusion of NF<sub>3</sub> emissions under the carbon tax is expected to affect the trade-exposed electronics sector. We will continue to consult industry and will provide sufficient transition period for the inclusion of NF<sub>3</sub>. Details on when it would be covered by carbon tax will be announced in due course. 

In all, the carbon tax currently covers 80% of our total GHG emissions from about 50 facilities mainly from the manufacturing, power, waste, and water sectors. Facilities in other sectors would also indirectly face a carbon price on the electricity they consume as power generation companies are expected to pass on some degree of their own tax burden through increased electricity tariffs. When we account for fuel excise duties that incentivise reduction of transport emissions, the overall coverage rises to about 90%.

**3. Which other countries or jurisdictions have implemented carbon pricing?**

Singapore is not alone in pricing carbon. About 79 jurisdictions (45 national and 34 sub-national jurisdictions) have implemented carbon pricing. In 2021, these jurisdictions account for roughly 21.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions. A few of these jurisdictions such as Finland, Norway and Sweden have implemented carbon pricing as early as the 1990s. Other jurisdictions within the region that have announced plans to price carbon and introduce new carbon regulations include Indonesia and Brunei.

**4. What does our carbon tax measures under the Singapore Green Plan mean for individuals?**

Our strategies for climate action, including the carbon tax, take into account the needs of all stakeholders, including the low-income and the vulnerable.

Under the whole-of-nation Singapore Green Plan 2030, we have designed our range of adaption and mitigation measures to be inclusive and equitable. These measures support the building of a city in nature, an energy reset and a transition to a green economy, build a resilient future for all, and to minimise the adverse effects that climate change could have on the economy, society and our daily lives. 

For example, the Government has been improving the liveability of our public housing estates through novel ways of weaving greenery into our estates and towns, which reduces temperatures while improving air quality. HDB flats are also designed to maximise cross-ventilation, thereby reducing reliance on air-conditioning which is a large contributor to household utility bills. Another initiative is the introduction of energy-efficient centralised cooling systems in new HDB towns to support cooling. Coupled with the [10-year HDB Green Towns Programme’s initiatives](https://www.hdb.gov.sg/about-us/our-role/smart-and-sustainable-living/Green-Towns-Programme), energy consumption is further reduced as towns become cooler. These sustainability initiatives ensure that the impact of climate change on all residents are minimised.

The Government also provides support to help households reduce their emissions. Since December 2020, the Government has introduced incentives such as e-Vouchers ranging from $25 to $150 in value under the [Climate Friendly Households Programme ](https://www.climate-friendly-households.gov.sg/)to support lower-income households in purchasing more energy efficient and climate-friendly appliances. These e-Vouchers can be used to purchase appliances such as 3-ticks water efficient shower fittings (inclusive of installation costs if required) and energy efficient and climate-friendly refrigerators. With the adoption of these appliances, households are able to do their part for the environment by reducing their energy and water consumption while saving costs in the long run. 

To help households adjust to the impact of the carbon tax on their electricity and gas expenses, eligible HDB households are given an additional $20 GST Voucher – U-Save on top of the regular U-Save rebate each year from 2019 to 2021. Eligible households living in smaller HDB flats benefit more as they receive a larger quantum of U-Save rebates, and typically have smaller annual utilities bills. 

**5. How would the Government ensure that consumers are not over-charged by electricity retailers passing on more than 100 per cent of the carbon tax to consumers?**

Today's electricity retail market is competitive and discourages retailers from raising their electricity rates excessively. Nevertheless, EMA will continue to ensure fair and efficient conduct of market players. Government agencies will also work closely with the Consumer Association of Singapore (CASE) and Competition & Consumer Commission of Singapore to monitor the market for unfair pricing and coordinated price hikes which are anti-competitive.

**6. Will companies be able to use international carbon credits to offset their carbon tax liabilities?**

As part of the ongoing carbon tax review, the Government is studying the possibility of allowing the use of high-quality international carbon credits (aligned with the Paris Agreement’s Article 6 rules) to partially offset carbon tax liabilities. However, this option of using international credits will need to be balanced against the need to prioritise domestic abatement.
 
To comply with the [Article 6 rulebook](https://unfccc.int/process/the-paris-agreement/cooperative-implementation) decided at 26th Conference of the Parties (COP-26) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), international carbon offsets that are surrendered in lieu of carbon tax obligations must be authorised and possess corresponding adjustment to be eligible for use towards our climate targets under the Paris Agreement. This is to ensure that international carbon credits result in real emissions reduction and are not double counted. Currently, voluntary carbon credits in the market do not have corresponding adjustment and it will take time to develop credits with corresponding adjustments.
